Title: STOCHASTIC MODELING OF TOPOLOGICAL GEOPHYSICAL WAVES

Abstract:
In this Senior Thesis, a derivation is presented that demonstrates how the k-space phase
singularities in Poincairé inertia-gravity waves, which have been shown by Deplace, Venaille, and Marston to provided a novel, topological explanation for equatorial geophysical
waves [1], translate directly to measurable signals in the Fourier-transformed, unequal-time
cross-correlations of the relevant fields. It was shown that within the stochastically driven
Linear Shallow Water Equations that for height h and velocity u, the correlation function
C˜(ω) ≡ int_∞^−∞ exp(−iωτ)E[h(t + τ, k_x, k_y)u∗(t, k_x, k_y)] dτ , (E denoting expected value), contains
phase singularities analogous to those of the Poincairé waves. This result was supported by
correlations of data produced by a highly idealized numerical simulation of the Linear Shallow Water Equations, and compared to data taken from a more complex global atmospheric
climate model produced with the GCM program.
